### Universal Automated Vat Re-filler for Resin 3D Printers

This project details the design of an automated vat refiller for resin 3D printers, incorporating an automated system for mixing the resin thoroughly before it is added to the vat.

The aim of this project is to facilitate a fully automated process enabling users to buy resin in more economical quantities, such as 20L containers and to have the vat automatically refilled when the resin level is low.
